### PHP Query Builder

This is a **zero dependency fork** of the Doctrine DBAL Query Builder 2.7. It does not require the **Connection** as a dependency, so no database connection is required or available via this library! The only dependencies are on the `dev` side and those only include PHPUnit for testing.

The query builder produces ready-to-use SQL clauses for you with separate parameters to be injected into a connection implementation of your own choosing.

You can install the package using composer

    composer require ossipesonen/elixir
